# Documentation Overview

Welcome to the `string-metrics-wasm` documentation hub. This project blends high-performance
Rust/WASM bindings from [rapidfuzz-rs](https://github.com/rapidfuzz/rapidfuzz-rs) with TypeScript
convenience APIs to deliver an ergonomic, cross-runtime string similarity toolkit. Use this page as
a guide to the rest of the documentation.

## Core Concepts

- **WASM bindings** (`src/lib.rs`, `pkg/web/`) expose RapidFuzz distance/similarity primitives such
  as Levenshtein, Damerau-Levenshtein, Jaro/Jaro-Winkler, Indel, and LCS, compiled to a portable
  WebAssembly module.
- **TypeScript facade** (`src/index.ts`) layers additional helpers on top of the WASM exports:
  substring similarity, token ratios, RapidFuzz-style `process` helpers (`extract`/`extractOne`),
  normalization presets, and unified `distance` / `score` dispatchers. The API is camelCase-first
  but accepts snake_case aliases for compatibility with Fulmen/Crucible configs.
- **Similarity validator** (`similarity-validator/`) is a companion Rust CLI built on rapidfuzz-rs.
  It validates YAML fixtures, generates expected values, and keeps the TypeScript tests aligned with
  the canonical RapidFuzz implementation.

## Where to Go Next

- **Getting Started:** The main [README](../README.md) covers installation, quick start examples,
  and a detailed API reference.
- **Development Workflow:** See [docs/development.md](development.md) for local setup, project
  layout, build/test commands, and fixture management tips.
- **Publishing & Release Process:** Maintainers should follow [docs/publishing.md](publishing.md)
  for release checklists, `npm publish` workflow, and GitHub release guidance.
- **User Guides:** The [user-guide](user-guide/) directory currently contains a deep dive into the
  Suggestions API and will expand over time with more feature-specific guides.
- **Release Notes & Benchmarks:** The [releases](releases/) folder archives version-specific notes,
  while [benchmarks](benchmarks/) compare WASM performance across library iterations.
- **Validator Details:** Read [similarity-validator/README.md](../similarity-validator/README.md)
  for information on building and using the RapidFuzz-backed fixture validator.

## Intended Audience

- **Library Consumers** who want to add high-quality fuzzy matching to TypeScript/JavaScript
  applications across Node, Bun, and Deno.
- **Fulmen Ecosystem Contributors** needing compatibility with Crucible schemas and rapidfuzz-style
  scoring semantics.
- **Maintainers & Contributors** working on the Rust bindings, TypeScript extensions, or validator.
