# Release Notes: v0.1.0

**Release Date:** 2025-10-29

## Overview

Initial release of string-metrics-wasm: a high-performance TypeScript/WASM library for string
similarity metrics with a comprehensive "did you mean?" suggestions API.

## Key Features

### Core Metrics (WASM)

High-performance string similarity metrics via strsim-rs WASM bindings:

- **Levenshtein** - Distance and normalized similarity for general-purpose typo correction
- **Damerau-Levenshtein** - OSA and unrestricted variants for transposition-aware matching
- **Jaro / Jaro-Winkler** - Prefix-sensitive similarity for short strings and identifiers
- **Custom Jaro-Winkler** - Configurable prefix scaling and max prefix length

### Extended Features (TypeScript)

- **Substring Similarity** - Longest Common Substring with matched range tracking
- **Normalization Presets** - None, minimal, default, aggressive with Unicode support
  - Special handling for Turkish İ and German ß
  - Combining mark filtering
  - Punctuation removal (aggressive mode)

### Suggestions API

High-level "did you mean?" functionality combining metrics with ranking and filtering:

- **Multi-metric support** - Choose from 5 different algorithms
- **Normalization integration** - Apply presets before scoring
- **Prefix bonuses** - Optional 10% boost for prefix matches
- **Score filtering** - Configurable minimum threshold
- **Smart ranking** - Score descending, preserves candidate order for ties
- **Truncation** - Limit results to top N suggestions

### Development Tools

**Similarity Validator CLI:**

- Validates test fixtures against rapidfuzz-rs canonical implementation
- Generates authoritative expected values for all metrics
- Supports all categories: levenshtein, damerau_osa, damerau_unrestricted, jaro_winkler, substring,
  normalization_presets, suggestions
- Cross-platform builds (macOS x86_64/arm64, Linux x86_64, Windows x86_64)

**Test Infrastructure:**

- 47 test cases with 100% pass rate
- 6 fixture files following Crucible v2.0.0 schema
- Generator metadata tracking for reproducibility

## Technical Architecture

### Implementation Stack

- **WASM Core:** strsim-rs 0.11.x (Rust → WASM)
- **Validator:** rapidfuzz-rs 0.5.0 (Rust native)
- **Runtime:** TypeScript with Bun
- **Testing:** Vitest with fixture-driven approach

### Design Decisions

1. **Hybrid TypeScript/WASM:** Core metrics in WASM for performance, extended features in TypeScript
   for flexibility
2. **Validator uses rapidfuzz-rs:** Future-proofing for planned v0.2.0 migration
3. **Canonical fixtures:** Validator generates authoritative test data matching runtime behavior
   exactly
4. **Stable sorting:** Preserves candidate order for tied scores (deterministic output)

## Performance

- Levenshtein, Damerau, Jaro metrics run at near-native speed via WASM
- Substring similarity uses optimized dynamic programming (O(m·n))
- Normalization presets cached per call

## Test Results

```
Validator Tests:     46/46 passing (100%)
TypeScript Tests:    47/47 passing (100%)
Code Quality:        All checks passing (rustfmt, clippy, biome, prettier)
```

- [User Guide: Suggestions API](../user-guide/suggestions-api.md)
- [Development Guide](../development.md)
- [Bootstrap Plan](../../.plans/bootstrap-plan.md)

## Known Limitations

1. **WASM uses strsim-rs 0.11.x** - v0.2.0 will migrate to rapidfuzz-rs for full metric parity with
   validator
2. **No browser optimizations yet** - Works in Node/Bun, browser support untested
3. **No streaming API** - All operations are single-shot

## Breaking Changes

N/A - Initial release

## Migration Guide

N/A - Initial release

## Upgrade Path

v0.2.0 (planned):

- Migrate WASM from strsim-rs to rapidfuzz-rs
- Add CI integration with fixture validation
- Potential API refinements based on early feedback

## Credits

- Built with [wasm-bindgen](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen)
- Metrics from [strsim-rs](https://github.com/dguo/strsim-rs) (WASM) and
  [rapidfuzz-rs](https://github.com/rapidfuzz/rapidfuzz-rs) (validator)
- Test fixtures compatible with [Crucible](https://github.com/fulmenhq/crucible) schema v2.0.0
- Inspired by Python [rapidfuzz](https://github.com/maxbachmann/RapidFuzz) and Go implementations
