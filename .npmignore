# .npmignore - Controls what gets published to npm
#
# IMPORTANT: We need this file to override .gitignore for the pkg/web directory.
# Without this, the root .gitignore's "pkg/" line would prevent WASM files
# from being included in the npm package, even though they're in package.json "files".
#
# Strategy:
# 1. Ignore everything by default (safety first)
# 2. Un-ignore only what we explicitly want to publish (allowlist approach)

# Ignore everything

# Un-ignore published files (must match package.json "files" field)
